# hacker game 2017 (name WIP)

## Some notes or stuff IDK

### Networks

Boring stuff, but sort of backbone for interesting gameplay? Maybe?

#### Physical

How the nodes are actually connected. Uninteractable? (or make physical access gameplay element (after demo))

#### Logical

How nodes communicate. Can be edited by player. (is a gameplay element)

### World map

Tool for building logical networks. Only shows devices with public IP (of course)
